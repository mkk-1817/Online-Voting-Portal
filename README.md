# Online Voting Portal

## Abstract:

The Online Voting Portal project aims to address accessibility, transparency, and convenience issues in voting systems by developing an online platform for voting. Utilizing modern web technologies, the system provides robust user authentication, secure and anonymous voting, and multi-factor authentication for enhanced security. This README provides an overview of the project's objectives, features, modules, technologies used, and future plans.

## Problem Identification:

### Accessibility:
Many regions face low voter turnout due to accessibility issues. This project aims to provide a solution by allowing people to vote from anywhere with internet access, thereby increasing accessibility for all.

### Transparency and Trust:
Ensuring the integrity of the voting process is essential for fostering trust in democratic systems. By incorporating cryptographic protocols and secure voting methods, this system aims to enhance transparency and trust in the voting process.
